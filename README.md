# HGMJ

The code is this repository describes a server for a website, the purpose of which is to manage my mood journal.

## Installation

### Running the Website Using localhost

1. Clone the repository to your computer using the usual `git clone` method.
1. Install the node modules using `npm install`.
1. Run `npm start` and follow the link in the terminal. (If you're very crafty, you might want to try `npm run devstart` instead.)

Please note that, unless you reconstruct the database locally, you won't be able to access pages which use the database over localhost.

### Deploying the Server to the Cloud

At the time of writing, I'm using Heroku to host this website. See <https://hgmj.herokuapp.com/>. Heroku itself is awash with instructions on how to deploy and update apps.
